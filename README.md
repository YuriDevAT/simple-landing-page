#My first simple landing page for the FCC certificate.

For this project I worked with `flexbox` for the first time. The side has three section, `header`, which is fixed, `main` and `footer`. Using all these specific tags it is easier for screenreaders to tell apart. A `nav` tag is used to jump directly to the specific part within the page. I also worked with `media queries` for the first time, to make sure, this page works on every device.
